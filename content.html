    The climate in Australia during April averages 20&deg;C.<br>
    In the evening, the temperature reaches 20&deg;C.<br>
    Sunset occurs at 6:30pm.<br>
    Whilst Geelong is a coastal area, it is <strong>not</strong> very humid (0 - 10%) and may seem colder as a result.

    Rain is a possibility at any time of year in Geelong; whilst we are hopeful that this won&apos;t
