                    <h4>What to Wear</h4>
                    <p>
                        Guests can wear whatever they like to our wedding.

                        Guidelines on what is usually worn are listed below.
                        <br>

                        If you have special dietary requirements (for eaxmple - vegetarian, or vegan, or have food allergies, or foods that
                        you do not eat for religious reasons) then you <strong>MUST</strong> let us know before the day, so that your
                        meals can be prepared accordingly.
                        You cna advise us of dietary requirements via email.

                        The tradition in Australia is that guests can choose to bring gifts to a newly married couple.<br>

                        A table will be available at the <strong>evening reception</strong> where guests can place gifts upon arrival, or at a time of their choosing.<br>
                        The table also has a &apos;Wishing Well&apos; where monetary gifts (inside an envelope) can be given.<br>
                        Gifts are entirely optional, and will not be unwrapped at the event.

                        Whilst Geelong is a coastal area, it is <strong>not</strong> very humid (0 - 10%) and may seem colder as a result.

                    <p>
                        Rain is a possibility at any time of year in Geelong; whilst we are hopeful that this won&apos;t
                        occur during the outdoor ceremony, this is not something we can control.
                        <br>
                        We have arranged for a sheltered area to be available if required.

                        In April last year, there were: 19 days without rain - 8 days with negligible rain (less than 1mm) -  and 4 days with &gt;1mm rain.

                    <p>
                        You will need to <strong>keep both of the following in your hand luggage</strong> when you get back to the airport:
                    </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the item</li>
                            <li>the receipt for the item</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>
                        You will need to show both of these at the <strong>TRS desk</strong>, in the Australian airport, immediately after you travel through customs.
                        <br>
                        The queue can be very long, so you should allow yourself extra time at the airport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make the process faster, you can download the <a href="https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Ente/Tour/TRS-applications" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TRS app</a> and record your item(s) in the app before you get to the airport.
                        <br>
                        If you do this, then you can use the shorter (faster) queue.
                        <br>
                        Do not use the short queue unless you have entered your purchases into the app (when you get to the desk you will simply be sent to the back of the longer queue).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Australian Customs Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        Australia has very strict laws regarding what items you are allowed to bring into the country.
                        <br>
                        These laws are designed to protect the delicate ecosystem and farming industries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Items that cannot be brought into Australia include: Plants, Meat, Fruit, Seeds, Clothing/shoes that have been in wilderness areas (wash them first), weapons, and illegal drugs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will be required to complete a form on arrival to Australia, and might have your luggage inspected by an Australian Customs official.
                        <br>
                        If you are unsure about whether specific items in your luggage are allowed, you should ask staff when you land at the airport.

                        <br>
                        Note that you can be issued an expensive fine for traveling <strong>even 3km above the speed limit</strong>.

                    <p>
                        The police in Australia are (generally) helpful, friendly, and can be trusted.
                        <br>
                        However - Police in Australia <strong>do not accept cash (or other) bribes</strong>.
                        <br>
                        Trying to bribe a police officer will only get you into <strong>more</strong> trouble.
